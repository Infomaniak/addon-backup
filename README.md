## Backup Process

There are 2 types of backups possible.

### Back-up specific folders

When you select "Back-up specific folders" the field "Folders to back-up" appears. You can specify several folders (separate each path with a ","). You must enter the absolute path of each folder that you want to save.

Example : /root/admin/, /home/user1/, /jelastic/containers/

In this example 3 folders have been specified.

After specifying these folders, you must select a backup frequency.



### Snapshot of the whole container

When you select "Snapshot of the whole container", the field "Backup all file system" appears.
This allows you to save the entire file system of your container.
Please note that some files are excluded: /dev, /proc, /sys, /run
Any filesystem which isnâ€™t specifically mounted as part of the root partition will be excluded, including virtual file systems.

### Backup frequency

2 backup frequencies are available:

    - Daily 
    
    - Hourly
    
Daily provides a backup of your files once a day at 08:00 p.m.

Hourly provides a backup of your files every hour (at the start of the hour at 1:00 p.m. for example)

### Backup retention

You can define how long to keep your backups (in years, months, days and hours).
If you want to keep your backups forever set the parameters to 0
Example:
If you backup every hour and you define a retention policy to 1 year, 2 months, 4 days, 2 hours, then every backup performed will be available for this defined period ( =10322 backups)
Note that the retention policy (deletion of the backups) is done all days at 10:30PM (UTC)

Example:

You back up your filesystem with the Hourly backup policy and you choose 1 year, 2 months, 4 days, 2 hours.
This means that every single backup will be available over a period of 1 year, 2 months, 4 days, 2 hours.

### Requirement 

You need to have at least one container lit with the add-on installed to see all your backups

## Restoration Process
